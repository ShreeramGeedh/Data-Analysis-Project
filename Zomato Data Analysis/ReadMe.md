# Hello, guys, welcome to this Geospatial Zomato analysis project.

## So what exactly is the Zomato?
- It's basically online food delivery company, which is right now available in 20 plus countries.
- So according to a survey that is being done by some of the body, it is estimated that somehow approx, eight orders, Zomato is going to receive per second.
- So just try to imagine how much huge amount of data customers are producing.
- So now basically I analyzed this data and I find some of the insights from this data which helpful for decision making.

## So now you can come across to a question, "What type of analysis I performed on this is the Zomato data?"
- I Performed geo-graphical analysis which is also called as geospatial analysis
- Geospatial analysis is the gathering, display, and manipulation of imagery, GPS, satellite photography and historical data, described explicitly in terms of geographic coordinates or implicitly, in terms of a street address, postal code, or forest stand identifier as they are applied to geographic models.
